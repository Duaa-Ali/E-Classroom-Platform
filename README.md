E-Classroom Platform
Our e-classroom platform is designed to enhance the educational experience by providing students with a user-friendly interface to manage their academic activities. Built with HTML and CSS, this frontend-only solution allows students to:

View and manage their assignments
Access and download teachers' uploads
Communicate directly with their faculty through a messaging system
Keep track of their courses and related materials

The platform aims to streamline the educational process and foster better communication between students and teachers.
